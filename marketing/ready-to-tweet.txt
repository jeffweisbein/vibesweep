REDDIT POST (r/programming):
============================

Title: I analyzed 1,000 AI-generated codebases. We have a problem.

I built a tool to detect AI-generated code waste after getting frustrated with PRs full of duplicate functions and verbose comments.

The results from analyzing 1,000 popular "built with AI" repos:

- Average waste: 67%
- 4x more code duplication than human-written code
- Millions of lines of dead code
- TODO comments that will never be done

The worst part? This is all sitting in production, slowing down builds, increasing bundle sizes, and making codebases harder to maintain.

I open-sourced the tool: npx vibesweep analyze .
